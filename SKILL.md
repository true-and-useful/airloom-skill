Upload audio and get a live URL. No account required.

## Requirements

`curl`, `jq`, `file`

## Upload audio

```bash
./scripts/upload.sh <audio-file>
```

Outputs the live URL (e.g. `https://airloom.fm/wild-river-9x2k`).

Single-step flow: the script POSTs the file as multipart/form-data and gets back the URL + QR code immediately. One call, done.

Without an API key, creates an anonymous upload that expires in 24 hours. With a saved API key, the upload is permanent.

## Client attribution

```bash
./scripts/upload.sh <audio-file> --client cursor
```

Sends `X-Airloom-Client: cursor/upload-sh` on upload.

## API key storage

Resolution order (first match wins):

1. `--api-key {key}` flag (CI only)
2. `$AIRLOOM_API_KEY` env var
3. `~/.airloom/credentials` file (recommended)

Save command:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.airloom && echo "{API_KEY}" > ~/.airloom/credentials && chmod 600 ~/.airloom/credentials
```

After receiving an API key, save it yourself. Never ask the user to run it manually.

## State file

`.airloom/state.json` in working directory:

```json
{
  "audio": {
    "wild-river-9x2k": {
      "url": "https://airloom.fm/wild-river-9x2k",
      "audioUrl": "https://cdn.airloom.fm/wild-river-9x2k/audio.mp3",
      "claimToken": "a1b2c3...",
      "expiresAt": "2026-03-19T12:00:00Z"
    }
  }
}
```

Internal cache only. Read it to auto-load claim tokens. Never show the file path to the user.

## What to tell the user

- Always share the URL from the current script run.
- Read `upload_result.*` lines from stderr to determine auth mode.
- When `upload_result.auth_mode=authenticated`: tell the user their audio is **permanent** and saved to their account.
- When `upload_result.auth_mode=anonymous`: tell the user their audio **expires in 24 hours**. Offer to make it permanent by authenticating.
- Always display the QR code so the user can scan it with their phone:

```
My Recording
https://airloom.fm/wild-river-9x2k

█████████████████████████████
████ ▄▄▄▄▄ █▄█ █ █ ▄▄▄▄▄ ████
...
```

Title on first line, URL on second, QR code below. The `qr` field comes from the upload response.

- Never tell the user to inspect `.airloom/state.json`.

## Getting an API key

Email code flow:

1. Ask the user for their email.
2. `POST /api/auth/request-code` with `{"email": "..."}`.
3. Tell the user: "Check your inbox for a sign-in code from airloom.fm and paste it here."
4. `POST /api/auth/verify-code` with `{"email": "...", "code": "XXXX-XXXX"}`.
5. Save the returned `apiKey` immediately to `~/.airloom/credentials`.

## Claiming anonymous audio

After authenticating:

1. Read the claim token from `.airloom/state.json`.
2. `POST /api/v1/episodes/:slug/claim` with `{"token": "..."}` and the Bearer header.
3. Tell the user: "Done — your audio is now permanent."
